While this seems like the type punt that leads to large gambling losses, it produced some interesting results due to the way the casino offered this deal. A key element of this strategy is that when you are in the money so have grown capital above the initial investment, you only have to keep betting the same initial investment rather than the total amount in your account. For example, suppose we invest \\\\$100 of our own money resulting in overall capital of \\\\$200.

This strategy is perfectly hedged against any outcome of each individual spin, constraining the loss each spin to the house edge.
